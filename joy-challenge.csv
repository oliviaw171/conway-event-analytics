4,No,No,Yes,Yes,More than 6,Yes,Yes,Yes,I loved the Hatchery sessions that helped me prepare!,"More clarity on the expectations - my team and a few others went into this challenge thinking it was about product or service building (with a final entrepreneur & VC-based judges' panel like UMass' competition), but the faculty-based judges' panel and criteria actually reflected a social entrepreneurship challenge.","Clarity on the expectations! The challenge signup advertising was very vague as well, so a lot of students never considered it as an opportunity they might enjoy.",Yes

5,Yes,Kinda,Yes,Yes,4-6,Yes,Yes,Not sure,I liked how the Joy Challenge gave us the motivation and time to launch our project,,The music in the joy showcase was a little too loud especially for those near the speaker,Yes
4,Kinda,Kinda,Yes,Yes,More than 6,Yes,Yes,Yes,Asking others for advice and working with determination,I think the challenge was good. what could change is more explanations on what not to do for the challenge,Directing students to the right resources,No
5,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,More than 6,Yes,Yes,Yes,I enjoyed the bi-weekly interaction with Lauren and the Campus Care Collective team.,N/A,Establishing team norms would have improved our experience.,No
5,No,No,Yes,Kinda,More than 6,Yes,No,Yes,The Hatchery was extremely important for developing our project. ,"Expectations of what a winning project looks like would have been so helpful. At every step of this challenge, our team had no idea if we were working up to the judges standards or expectations. I also think that the judges were very biased because some of us had closer relationships with certain professors or directors, which came through in the showcase. The Milestones were helpful, however, we did not understand what the reviewers were looking for. How were we being judged? Milestone 2 was too simplistic because the word counts were so short. This did not allow us to show the judges the extent of our work and impact on the community. How much did the SDGs come into play? They seemed to be an after thought at times. Were they important for udging purposes?","I think there needs to be more awards given out, especially in different categories such as community engagement, leadership, and more. I do want to mention that not giving out the Perseverance award to someone in the Hatchery group that we are all friends with and know what has been going on with her health and the health of her teammate was very upsetting, disappointing, and angering. Many students felt this way when this slide popped up on the screen.",No
5,Kinda,Kinda,Yes,Kinda,4-6,Yes,Yes,Yes,"The TED-style talks worked well for me, and I think possibly the majority of people as well. Being able to have notecards and more time allowed for more opportunity to talk more in depth about our projects.","More clear information about various things like lunch, and maybe less weight on just the Milestones. Also, allowing for the use of contracts to decide how prize money is split would be very beneficial since this would encourage students to continue working on their project even after the Challenge is over. For example, there could be tools offered through the Conway Center where groups can meet with someone from Conway to agree upon and sign a contract to allocate a percentage to each individual member, and a percentage to the project itself (either by a business bank account or kept and organized at Conway which acts as a little bank for the ventures). ","Occasionally hosting an event in partnership with another group on campus like with DTI staff at the DTI building, or in the Mcconnell basement for 3D printing, or at the Alumni Gym at the UX lab, etc. together in groups from the Challenge could be beneficial and make it that much easier for students to see more clearly what's offered to them in terms of resources on campus and how we can use them in our projects. Also this makes it easier to then book more appointments and use these resources more frequently; the hardest part is taking the first step and I think that's potentially a barrier for some students. If we could explore/have an introduction to these resources hands on through the Conway Center I think it would improve the quality and development of many projects in the Challenge.",Yes

5,Yes,Kinda,Kinda,Yes,1-3,Yes,Yes,Not sure,"The resources and workshops provided by Joy Challenge are really helpful for me. It has really broadened my horizons on how to start something to make your idea come true. Plus, I really enjoy working on the keywords SDG goals this semester. ","I feel like it would be better if we could have a Joy Challenge community. There are lots of participants with wonderful ideas I met only during the Joy challenge, and I think it would be great if I could met them earlier. ",,No
3,Kinda,No,Yes,Yes,1-3,Not sure,No,Yes,Seed money was used directly for our project to make a prototype,"Clearer expectations and guidelines about how to use award money. Also, communication with administration if something is to be done on campus, as we are facing resistance at the moment to install permanent structures despite the huge amount of effort put in to design and prototyping.",Maybe an intro booklet or packet to help orient teams towards expectations of the challenge?,No
5,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,More than 6,Yes,Yes,Yes,,the deadlines were too close  ,"Lunch time, also letting people know where they can print their presentation",No
